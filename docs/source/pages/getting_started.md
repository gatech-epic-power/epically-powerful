# Getting Started

Before you dive into the tutorials and using epicallypowerful, it's important you decide exactly what you will be working with. The Parts Picker can help you determine what specific devices fit your use case, but the most inexpensive and basic startup involves the following.

1) Raspberry Pi 4B+ (Plus mouse, keyboard, monitor, power supply, and other necesities)
2) Waveshare RS485 CAN Hat
3) MicroSD card
4) CyberGear Micromotor or TMotor AK80-9 (+ Connectors/Cables)
5) ~24V battery or benchtop power supply
6) Soldering Iron

The above is the minimum required to start moving a motor and writing scripts with epicallypowerful.

We highly recommend however that you read through the setup and tutorial pages relevant to your application **before** you try to write your code or collect data.
