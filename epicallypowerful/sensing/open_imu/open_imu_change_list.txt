Things to check/change with OpenIMUs:
- How to change (ideally increase) data sampling rate from 100 Hz upward?
    - Should be able to do so from Python driver (connected to OpenIMU)
        - USE UART COMMUNICATION PORTS ON OPENIMU
        - Possible sampling rates: 200 Hz, 100 Hz, etc.
    - Increase baud rate? (We assume the current is the default: 250 kbps)
    - Other setting that we don't know about on the OpenIMU300RIs?
- Check if there are any operation/performance differences between 300RI and 330RI or 335RI series of these units
- How do we get magnetometers to function?
- What are the operating voltage limits for these units?
    - 330RI sheet says 9-32V, but 300RI says 5-32V. EXPERIMENTAL CONFIRMATION: bumping up voltage from 5-12V enabled the system to function properly!
- How to set CAN ID?
    - What is the default CAN ID? Out-of-the-box 300RI unit has CAN ID of 4 (004), but online documentation says that it should be 0x80 (128 as base 10 int). Could it be an older firmware version that uses CAN 2.0A instead of CAN 2.0B (J1939) with extended 29-bit ID protocol?
- How to enable IMU to function out of the box? Current attempts unsuccessful
    - Do we need to update firmware?
- Where can we get our hands on a ST-link unit for testing?
- Get parts list for:
    - OpenIMU 300RI (and other versions)
    - Ampseal connectors (6-pin type)
    - Pins for inserting into Ampseal units
- Plot performance against MicroStrain units
- How to configure different components for IMU
    - Currently, magnetometer data not published
- How do streaming rates change with more and more IMUs added?
- Did Google X team change axes??
